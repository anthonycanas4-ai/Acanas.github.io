Welcome to my portfolio! 
======

Graduating with a BS in Information Technology (4.0 GPA), I recently led
the AmeriCorps AI Chatbot project, managing timelines and improving HR
eﬃciency. Furthermore, I also designed and deployed a centralized
PostgreSQL database for a multi-location bookstore franchise, integrating
vendor, inventory, sales, and employee systems to optimize operational
eﬃciency. I also contributed to a 10% increase in weekly upsells at Kohls
utilizing my customer service expertise. These experiences have collectively
enhanced my problem-solving, organizational, and technical skills.

About Me
======

Hi, I’m Anthony Canas, a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, where I completed my degree with a 4.0 GPA. I focus on building practical solutions that improve efficiency, streamline workflows, and make technology easier to use.

I supported HR operations by helping develop the AmeriCorps AI chatbot, managing the project with Microsoft Project Professional, and guiding the team to ensure smooth operations. This included automating SOP workflows, updating existing procedures, and creating new ones to reduce manual work and maintain consistency.

I also built a centralized PostgreSQL database for a multi-location bookstore franchise, integrating vendor, inventory, sales, and employee data to improve accuracy and reporting.

I enjoy designing efficient systems, solving complex technical challenges, and learning new tools that make technology smarter and more accessible. I am currently expanding my skills in cloud technologies, automation, and advanced data workflows.

If you are looking for someone who combines technical ability, organization, and real-world impact, I would be excited to connect.

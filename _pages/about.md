About Me
======

Hi, I'm Anthony Canas, a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, where I completed my degree with a 4.0 GPA. I focus on building practical, real-world solutions that improve efficiency, streamline workflows, and make technology easier for people to use.

I have experience supporting HR operations by helping automate SOP workflows, including organizing, updating, and creating new standard operating procedures. I improved the process of retrieving existing SOPs, restructuring them, and developing new versions that reduced manual work and helped HR teams maintain consistency and accuracy.

I also built a centralized PostgreSQL database for a multi-location bookstore franchise, integrating vendor, inventory, sales, and employee data into one unified system to improve operational accuracy and reporting.

Alongside my technical work, I apply strong communication and user-focused problem-solving skills that help me translate organizational needs into clear technical solutions.

I enjoy designing efficient systems, breaking down complex technical challenges, and learning new tools that make technology smarter and more accessible. I am currently expanding my skills in cloud technologies, automation, and advanced data workflows.

If you are looking for someone who combines technical ability, organization, and real-world impact, I would be excited to connect.

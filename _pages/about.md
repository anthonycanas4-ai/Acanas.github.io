About Me
======

Hi, I'm Anthony Canas, an Information Technology student graduating with a 4.0 GPA with hands-on experience building practical, real-world solutions. I focus on creating systems that improve efficiency, streamline workflows, and make technology easier for people to use.

I recently led the AmeriCorps AI Chatbot project, where I managed timelines, designed system workflows, and helped improve HR efficiency through automation. I also built and deployed a centralized PostgreSQL database for a multi-location bookstore franchise, integrating vendor, inventory, sales, and employee systems to improve operations and data accuracy.

Alongside technical work, I bring strong customer experience skills, including contributing to a 10 percent increase in weekly upsells at Kohl's by understanding user needs and communication patterns.

I enjoy solving problems, breaking down complex technical tasks into clear solutions, and learning new tools that help me build smarter systems. I am currently expanding my skills in cloud technologies, automation, and advanced data workflows.

If you are looking for someone who can combine technical ability, organization, and real-world impact, I would be excited to connect.

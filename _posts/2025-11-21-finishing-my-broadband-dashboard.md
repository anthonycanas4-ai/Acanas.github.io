I recently completed an interactive broadband data dashboard highlighting connectivity challenges in rural North Carolina. This project allowed me to combine data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving to address real community needs and make the digital divide more visible to a wider audience.

Having just graduated with my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from UNC Greensboro, I’m reflecting on the projects I’ve worked on — from building database systems for a bookstore franchise to supporting HR process automation with the AmeriCorps AI chatbot — and how they’ve strengthened my technical skills and problem-solving abilities.

Looking ahead, I’m preparing to earn my CompTIA A+ certification, which will expand my IT knowledge, improve my troubleshooting skills, and help me transition into my first professional role. I’m excited to continue building tools and solutions that make an impact, and I’ll be sharing updates on the broadband dashboard and my certification journey soon.

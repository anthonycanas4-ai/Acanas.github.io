I designed and built a unified PostgreSQL relational database for Beyond Borders Books, a multi-location bookstore chain, to streamline operations across books, customers, employees, vendors, cafe sales, warehouses, and transactions. Using an ER diagram created in ERDPlus, I structured the schema with proper primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints, then imported and cleaned CSV datasets to ensure full referential integrity. I resolved data consistency issues, corrected schema relationships, and optimized table structures using ALTER TABLE commands. To support business insights, I developed SQL views for inventory status, sales performance, employee productivity, vendor supply chains, and customer purchase histories. The completed system enables real-time tracking, automated reporting, and a scalable, efficient data management workflow that supports future growth and simplified decision-making for the organization.

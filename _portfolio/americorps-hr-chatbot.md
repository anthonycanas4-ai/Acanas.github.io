I managed the development of a generative AI chatbot for AmeriCorps Human Resources to help staff quickly access policies, SOPs, FAQs, and internal documents. Using Microsoft Project Professional, I created the project plan, organized the Work Breakdown Structure, built the Gantt chart, developed the schedule and budget, and tracked progress using earned value analysis. I coordinated with HR teams to identify operational needs, supported workflow standardization, and helped ensure the AI tool improved efficiency by reducing manual document retrieval and streamlining HR processes. This project strengthened HR operations by improving consistency, supporting better decision-making, and providing a foundation for future AI-driven tools within the organization.

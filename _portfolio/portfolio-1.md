### Education & Unemployment Data Analysis (Python, Pandas, Colab)

[**Google Colab Notebook**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1k0AGJdvPSad92TrNB4uI_Od6lo13MoDj?usp=sharing#scrollTo=Mwam10vnfdCO)

This project explores whether higher levels of education are associated with lower unemployment rates using U.S. labor data. After cleaning and preparing the dataset in Python, I visualized the relationship with a scatter plot and performed a Pearson correlation test. The analysis found a strong negative correlation (–0.936), showing that unemployment decreases as education increases, with results statistically significant based on the low p-value. I also examined an additional dataset showing educational attainment across various occupations, revealing that management and executive roles consistently require higher degrees. The project demonstrates skills in data cleaning, visualization, statistical testing, and working with real-world datasets in Google Colab.

### Beyond Borders Books – PostgreSQL Relational Database System

I designed and built a unified PostgreSQL relational database for Beyond Borders Books, a multi-location bookstore chain, to streamline operations across books, customers, employees, vendors, cafe sales, warehouses, and transactions. Using an ER diagram created in ERDPlus, I structured the schema with proper primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints, then imported and cleaned CSV datasets to ensure full referential integrity. I resolved data consistency issues, corrected schema relationships, and optimized table structures using ALTER TABLE commands. To support business insights, I developed SQL views for inventory status, sales performance, employee productivity, vendor supply chains, and customer purchase histories. The completed system enables real-time tracking, automated reporting, and a scalable, efficient data management workflow that supports future growth and simplified decision-making for the organization.
